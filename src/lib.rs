//! Design-based sampling methods, with a focus on spatially balanced and balanced sampling designs.

//! **Balanced sampling** utilizes auxilliary information in order to obtain a sample where the
//! Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator of the total of the auxilliary information equals the population
//! total of the auxilliaries.
//! This may be very efficient (yield relatively low variance) if there is a linear relationship
//! between the auxilliaries and the variable of interest.
//!
//! **Spatially balanced sampling** uses auxilliary information in order to obtain a sample that is
//! well-spread in auxilliary space, as well as being balanced.
//! The samples can then be seen as a miniature version of the population.
//! This generally yields low variances for the variable of interest, if there is a general
//! relationship between the auxilliaries and the variables of interest.
